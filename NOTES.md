Architecture ideas

- Soundcloud API
- Any other free music APIs (if any good other ones are around)

Server

- Node, Express, Socket.io
- WebRTC? Mabye
-> Probably node

Next steps

1. Music API & requirements
2. Backend org for user names and active rooms
3. Client
4. P2P hosting 
  - which song is playing, syncing up the chat, etc
